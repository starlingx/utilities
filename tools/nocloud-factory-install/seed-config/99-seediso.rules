# This udev rule triggers when a block device representing a
# CD/DVD drive (e.g., /dev/sr0, /dev/sr1, etc.) detects a
# media change (like a disc or an ISO being detected).
# Specifically, it applies under the following conditions:
#
# The device is part of the block subsystem.
# The kernel name matches sr*, which means it's a SCSI CD-ROM
# device.
# The ID_CDROM_MEDIA environment variable is set to "1",
# indicating that media (a disc) is present in the drive.
# The udev ACTION is "change", which typically happens when
# media is inserted or removed.
#
# When all of these conditions are met, the rule:
#  Adds the systemd tag to the udev event (allowing systemd
#  to process it).
#  Instructs systemd to start the cloud-init-seed.service
#  as a result of this event.
